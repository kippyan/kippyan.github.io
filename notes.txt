Some recommendations for Project 2 and the rest of the class going forward:

1. Organize the website in a coherent manner
   Use an index page to link to the other web files from, and make it look like a cohesive project.

2. Make charts readable
    rename axes to include a plain english description, not just variable names
    If there are factors, make sure they are readable
      If there are a crapton of factors, make that clear, change the scale, or whatever.
    
3. Initial model is initial
    An appropriate interperetation of the data is key to all assignments, particularly deliverable 2.
    
4. display the content of the data
    the best way to do this visually is by just writing the tagble name at the end of a block 

5. Use the work from the previous assignments in the sequence without having to run the code again
