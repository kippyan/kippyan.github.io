      <h1> Olivia Lund Data Science Portfolio Project </h1>
      <p> I'm a computer science student at California State University, Chico. </p>
      <p> This site hosts the deliverables for the main project of CSCI 385 - Data Science, taught by Dr. Kevin Buffardi, from when I took it in the fall of 2019. </p>
      <p> The portfolio project is intended to explore data sets connected by a subject or theme using theory and principles of data science, implemented using the advanced statistical methods provided in the R programming language. </p>

      <h2> Project Deliverables</h2>
      <div class = "deliverable">
        <h4> Part 1: Organizing and Exploring </h4>
        <p> This section of the project focuses on identifying a large and varied dataset that interesting analyses could be drawn from, and using the principles of tidy data to clean it up.</p>
        <p> For this section of the project, I chose a dataset containing daily meteorological reports from New Delhi, India, spanning from 1996 until 2014. </p>

        <h4> Part 2: Analyzing and Predicting </h4>
        <p>This section of the project focuses more on predictive models, using an R library that trains a machine learning system on a portion of the data, and assesses how accurately it predicts the values of the rest of the dataset. In addition, it features an additional dataset to provide a more robust understanding of the subject. </p>
