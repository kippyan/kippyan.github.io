      <h1> Website of Olivia Lund </h1>
      <p> I like learning cool stuff and sharing it with people. </p>
      <p> My favorite subjects are programming, math, physics, and the places where those three aligh, although I could probably talk at length about just about anything. I also most likely have. </p>
      <p> This site is for me to share cool stuff I've learned. It is also a work in progress. Learning is lifelong, so I might get to it someday! </p>
